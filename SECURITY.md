## Security Best Practices

When using The Pair:

- **API Keys**: Never commit your AI provider API keys to version control
- **Workspace**: Be aware of which directories you grant the app access to
- **Permissions**: Review the permissions requested by each Pair session
- **Updates**: Keep the app updated to the latest version

## Known Security Considerations

- The Pair executes AI-generated commands in your local environment
- Always review changes before accepting them in manual approval mode
- Use workspace-scoped permissions to limit file system access
- The app requires access to your opencode configuration for AI model access

Thank you for helping keep The Pair secure!
